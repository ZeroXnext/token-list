# L2 Multichain Token Compliance

A unified, transparent, and secure standard for cross-chain token listings that every wallet, exchange, and DeFi platform can trust and integrate.

# Why?

## 1. Compliance Inconsistencies

Token listing rules vary widely across platforms, leading to misalignment and potential security risks. Multichain Token Compliance L2 enforces consistent compliance standards across all chains, ensuring your token meets the rules once—and everywhere.

## 2. Lack of Transparency

Listing processes are often opaque. Platforms require extensive documentation, legal checks, or manual validation. This infrastructure automates compliance verification while providing auditable transparency for both token owners and listing platforms.

## 3. Inefficiency

Existing manual scripts and ad-hoc processes are slow, error-prone, and hard to maintain. With stateless rule plugins, developers can define compliance rules up-front, integrate them with CI/CD pipelines, and enforce them automatically.

## 4. Trust & Security

Developers no longer need to roll their own compliance tooling for each platform. Our infrastructure ensures that token standards (ERC20, PERM2, etc.) are enforced consistently, reducing operational risk and enabling faster, safer development.

## 5. Clear Ownership

Token owners and listing platforms can rely on a single source of truth for compliance, avoiding fragmented scripts or reliance on unmaintained external tooling.
